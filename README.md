#Flix Faves

###Description

Welcome to the codebase of the Flix Faves application. This application enables the user to create an account through 
their gmail login to save the movies they want to watch. Users can search movies as well as browse upcoming and current movies. 
When viewing their list, users are alerted when movies they have saved are currently in theaters or will be coming to theaters in the next week.
The application is built with React, Javascript, and Sass. Webpack is used to organize and compile the code. Testing was done using Mocha and Chai.
